Are we going to have the users actually be able to input their data?

Instead of circles, use progress bars, or bar graphs maybe.

One bar that shows both exercise and food and how close you are to your goal for that day will be more intuitive than using a circle graph like originally planned.

We don¡¯t want to deal with the extreme cases where someone might eat 2-3 times their expected number and then  it will mess up the visualization.
